          Seasons Seychelles</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-content-3">
            We were spending eight days in the Seychelles, and when we booked this trip many months ago, we initially booked five nights at the Four Seasons Desroches Island, which was going to be the “highlight” of our trip. I’ll talk more about that booking process when I review that hotel, but we booked a (publicly available) pre-opening rate there.
            <br> <br> For our three nights on Mahe Island (the main island in the Seychelles) we didn’t know where we wanted to stay. At first we were going to stay at the Le Meridien Fisherman’s Cove, but Tiffany had a not-great experience there. She said the Hilton Seychelles Northolme was much better, so we were looking at that. However, the rate was around 500EUR for our dates, and since Tiffany will (hopefully) be reviewing that soon, I figured we should try something else.

        <h2>Booking</h2>
        <p>Rates for this property were much lower than I was expecting for an Autograph Collection hotel in a major city, but I was able to book a one-night stay for only $133 after taxes.

        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>EMC2 is located in a prime spot, just a block and a half away from Michigan Avenue and the never-ending shops and restaurants on the Magnificent Mile. This place is very neat.</p>

        <h2>Check-in</h2>
        <p>Space is at a premium in downtown Chicago, and this hotel didn’t waste an inch of it. In fact, I ended up walking past the entrance twice before figuring out which door to go in.</p>

        <p>Now let’s take a look at food at the resort. Breakfast is included for all guests at the Four Seasons, and is served daily at ZEZ Restaurant, from 7AM until 10:30AM. ZEZ Restaurant was located near the center of the resort, a few flights of stairs down from reception.</p>
